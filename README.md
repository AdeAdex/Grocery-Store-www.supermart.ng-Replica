# grocery-store
This is a grocery supermarket developed by myself. 
This grocery store was created in just 2 weeks and after that, i have a week rest and modify it for another one week, though it still need some JavaScript effect to make it fully function and that will be done another time.
Please note that this web site is very responsive on all devices (mobile, ipad and computer system).
In case you want to try and see how wonderful the site is working, by navigating or visiting other pages, please take note of the following buttons, images and text that you may click to navigate as at the time of developing this site but before that, kindly let me tell you that the "Change Area" button at the top of the page is working for you to change where you want your goods and services delivered to and remember this is just a user interacting page without backend development code.
